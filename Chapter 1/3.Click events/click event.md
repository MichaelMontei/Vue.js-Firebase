So maybe we wanna click a button and change the age or the title. <br>
These are called directives in VUE. (v-on) => Vue-Onclick => v-on:click="age++"
But in Vue they made this easier and decided to replace the whole v-on thing with @click.
<br>
We can also call a method in our #app div -> to change our title. You can check this method in app.js! <br>
As a third and last method, we could also pass parameters in our method and call inside app.js with this.title = title!<br>
So lets dive into that!
