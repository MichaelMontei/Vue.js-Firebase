We will make 4 boxes with 4 different mouse events to demonstrate how we can handle them in Vue.
- mouseover
- mouseleave
- doubleclick
- mousemove

In the mousemove event we are giving properties in our return for x and y coordinates and they will start in the box.
Whenever we then trigger this event the offset will take over to check to mousemove.
